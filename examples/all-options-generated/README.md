# Generated Secret with all options

This example shows how to use the [random](modules/random) sub-module that will
generate a random secret value, while specifying every option available.

## Example at a glance

|Item|Managed by module|Description|
|----|----------|
|Access Control|&check;|User specified accounts will be granted view access to secret.|
|Cloud KMS key||Not managed by example; a suitable KMS key for encryption/decryption must be created externally in matching locations.|
|Replication|&check;|User specified locations will be  used for replication.|
|Secret Value|&check;|Generated by module.|
